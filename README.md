## Configuration

### Creating Configuration File

The application looks for configuration in these locations (in order):

2. `~/.config/iptv/config.toml` (recommended)

### Initial Setup

1. **Generate example configuration:**
   ```bash
   ./iptv
   ```
   This creates `config.example.toml` if no config is found.

2. **Copy and edit the configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Local config
   cp config.example.toml config.toml
   
   # Option 2: User config directory (recommended)
   mkdir -p ~/.config/iptv
   cp config.example.toml ~/.config/iptv/config.toml
   ```

3. **Edit configuration with your provider details:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/iptv/config.toml
   ```
