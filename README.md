- Internet connection for IPTV streaming

### Installing MPV
MPV is the recommended video player for the best experience:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install mpv
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install mpv
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install mpv
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S mpv
```

## Installation

### From Source (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd iptv

# Build the application
cargo build --release

# The binary will be available at target/release/iptv
```

### Development Build
```bash
cargo build
# Binary available at target/debug/iptv
```

## Configuration

### Creating Configuration File

The application looks for configuration in these locations (in order):
1. `./config.toml` (current directory)
2. `~/.config/iptv/config.toml` (recommended)

### Initial Setup

1. **Generate example configuration:**
   ```bash
   ./iptv
   ```
   This creates `config.example.toml` if no config is found.

2. **Copy and edit the configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Local config
   cp config.example.toml config.toml
   
   # Option 2: User config directory (recommended)
   mkdir -p ~/.config/iptv
   cp config.example.toml ~/.config/iptv/config.toml
   ```

3. **Edit configuration with your provider details:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/iptv/config.toml
   ```

### Configuration Format

```toml
# Multiple providers supported
[[providers]]
name = "My IPTV Service"
url = "https://your-server.com:port/player_api.php"
username = "your-username"
password = "your-password"

[[providers]]
name = "Secondary Provider"
url = "https://another-server.com:port/player_api.php"
username = "username2"
password = "password2"

[ui]
page_size = 20  # Items per page in menus
```

### Interactive Provider Setup

You can also add providers interactively:
```bash
./iptv add-provider
```

This will prompt you for provider details and automatically update your configuration.

## Usage

### TUI Mode (Recommended)

Launch the full terminal user interface:
```bash
./iptv --tui
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `‚Üë`/`k` | Move up |
| `‚Üì`/`j` | Move down |
| `PgUp` | Page up (10 items) |

### CLI Mode

```bash
./iptv
```

Navigate through menus using number selections and follow the prompts.

### Rofi Integration

This creates a searchable list of all your favourites across all providers.

## Troubleshooting

### MPV Not Found
If you see "MPV not found" warnings:
1. Install MPV using your system's package manager (see Prerequisites)
2. Ensure MPV is in your system PATH
3. The application will fall back to basic playback mode without MPV

### Configuration Issues

- Verify provider URLs and credentials
- Test provider connectivity with verbose logging: `./iptv -v`

### Playback Issues
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Check if streams work in MPV directly
- Try different stream quality if available
- Review debug logs: `./iptv --debug-log --tui`

### Performance Issues
- Clear cache files in `~/.cache/iptv/`
- Reduce page size in configuration
- Enable debug logging to identify bottlenecks
