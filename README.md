## Installation

### Using Cargo Install
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/your-username/iptv
```

## Configuration

### Creating Configuration File

The application looks for configuration in these locations (in order):
1. `./config.toml` (current directory)
2. `~/.config/iptv/config.toml` (recommended)

### Initial Setup

1. **Generate example configuration:**
   ```bash
   ./iptv
   ```
   This creates `config.example.toml` if no config is found.

2. **Copy and edit the configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Local config
   cp config.example.toml config.toml
   
   # Option 2: User config directory (recommended)
   mkdir -p ~/.config/iptv
   cp config.example.toml ~/.config/iptv/config.toml
   ```

3. **Edit configuration with your provider details:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/iptv/config.toml
   ```

### Configuration Format

```toml
# Multiple providers supported
[[providers]]
name = "My IPTV Service"
url = "https://your-server.com:port/player_api.php"
username = "your-username"
password = "your-password"

[[providers]]
name = "Secondary Provider"
url = "https://another-server.com:port/player_api.php"
username = "username2"
password = "password2"

[ui]
page_size = 20  # Items per page in menus
```

### Interactive Provider Setup

You can also add providers interactively:
```bash
./iptv add-provider
```

This will prompt you for provider details and automatically update your configuration.
